Note: nomenclature like (cN) at the start of a sentence or paragraph indicates "a confidence of N / 10".
Anything without once indicates a confidence of 9 or 10 / 10.

Bolded terms are my claims of dishonesty; italicised terms are just regular emphasis.

> I think Lulie Tanett's reply to Jack Birner's piece here is dead on.

In general this sort of comment & phrasing doesn't need to have bad social stuff in it, however, RSP is replying *only* to Lulie's comment and not to any of the other comments. There are multiple other threads - which he doesn't reply to. It's also a reply to OP, not to Lulie's comment (though as far as Facebook is concerned the threading is terrible, so this doesn't *need* to be done for self-aggrandising reasons).

He is **thanking Lulie for the tag** by replying like this and as a top-post - a little social dance.

His reply is also entirely **non-critical**, which is odd considering he's meant to be a prominent CR thinker.
It's also hard to believe he didn't have any issues with Lulie's post or interpretation -- unless he didn't bother to think much about it; **he should know better**.
It *might* be possible to reply casually such that a lax reading of Lulie's post was okay, but this is a CR forum!
Not reddit or a discussion about a restaurant or the movies.
His **inappropriate of tone is projecting low effort** (as in LoLE, not one of carelessness) -- we'll see more of this mismatch throughout his post.

> The quotation from Jack Birner's piece is verbose and largely incorrect.

The quotation is neither verbose (as some things were omitted) and isn't "largely" incorrect AFAIK; though there are errors like the ellipsis.
What RSP means is that this part of Birner's essay is verbose and largely incorrect.
'Extract' is a better word than 'quotation' -- this is **careless** and ambiguous.
If you brought this sort of thing up with someone a response like *you know what I meant* is typical. (Casual phrasing is okay when it suits the subject matter; this doesn't.)

He says *verbose*, which is sort-of-true. It is somewhat verbose (as in prolix) but the *bigger issue is the academese and fanciness*.
RSP is thus **non-specific** in an important way.
We know it's not that verbose because my [outline](../02-birner-quote/) of Birner's extract is of comparable length; if Birner's extract was *verbose* only, it would have a smaller extract.
I suspect RSP's writing is fancy, too.
If RSP writes in academese, then to criticise Birner for this would admit hypocrisy, so RSP would be **dodging criticism** (social agility).

RSP also **projects expertise**.

> I grant that some critical rationalists don't get out much (are introverted), but there are many who are quite extraverted.

(c7) "Don't get out much" is a somewhat pejorative way to talk about one's colleagues (so RSP does some **relative social-status elevation** here).

This is also a **false concession** since intro/extroversion isn't particularly relevant to Birner's argument.
Plenty of introverted ppl do politicking -- that's why the idea of "in the shadows" or puppet-master-ing is reasonably well known.

> Just look at me! Or David McDonagh!

RSP **name drops** someone.
I googled David McDonagh and found an anesthesiologist; once I added 'popper' to the search the first result was the CR facebook group, and the second was an article from libertarian.co.uk titled "Ray Scott Percival's The Myth of the Closed Mind, Reviewed by David McDonagh (2012)" 🤨.
Apparently D. McDonagh isn't extroverted enough to do much SEO.

RSP also uses himself as a counterpoint, which is anecdotal at best, but crucially **isn't arguing the point** well at all.
He could have e.g. pointed out that Birner didn't link the stated traits of CR-attracted personalities/characteristics to the idea they make it harder to do CR related work.

Aside: Birner doesn't take in to account what the goals of someone in CR are/should be.
If one is to do relevant philosophical work *simpliciter* then who cares about being an academic?
If one is to *be an academic* that is more problematic.
Both RSP and Lulie could have pointed that out, but it might have raised conflicts w/in them.

> I'm completely happy being surrounded by justificationists - just so I can have a go at them all at once. 😁

(c7) **Outright lie or bad thinking** -- this would mean RSP is fine with ppl having low-quality ideas in general as long as he has good ones (or something along those lines).
As he goes on it seems more like he cares about having *better ideas than other people* (i.e. relativity is important).
If it's not an outright lie, the 'bad thinking' is just as bad because **he should know better**.

Confidence explanation: "outright lie" is a strong claim; I'm hesitant to put it so bluntly. I think it's reasonable if true, though.

(c6) This statement is **pro-metaphorical-violence**, RSP is *aggrandising winning*, even though it's presumable the justificationists aren't convinced by RSP.
This is one reason it's metaphorically violent -- *RSP can't convince them so just attacks them instead*.

Confidence explanation: I've worded this pretty strongly, which might be unfair.

(c9) It's also **anti-Popper** because it's against the idea of *ideas dying in one's stead*.
The implication somewhat aligns with: justificationists have been, are, and always will be justificationists.
An alternate interpretation is that RSP is speaking collectively (in that there always will be justificationists), but that is contradicted by his next few sentences.
RSP implies he enjoys the debate more than improving ppl's ideas (and by extension, their lives). **He should know better**.

The emoji "😁" indicates RSP is pleased with himself, and **socially pressures others** to replicate that idea.

> When at the University of Warwick, I used to love finding a bunch of Marxist-Lenninists and throwing the Economic Calculation Problem at them plus the impossibility of justifying one's position.

RSP **concept drops** "the Economic Calculation Problem" (which I've never heard of before).
Wikipedia just says it's the problem of being unable to replicate market-driven prices with economic planning.
That's a fancy name for a simple problem.
Moreover, I'm pretty sure most Marxists/Leninists aren't super concerned about pricing; their arguments are often about other things like supposed tyranny / slavery via working / employment.
*Concept dropping* here is not making a point relevant to LT's post or Birner's extract (or at least I don't see how it is ATM).
It *is* relevant to RSP claiming he's extroverted, but it's just more anecdotes, which gives him an excuse for concept-dropping, **elevating relative social status** (with respect to justificationists and Marxists/Leninists), **institution dropping U of Warwick**.

"The impossibility of justifying one's position" is ambiguous. Does he mean throwing the combined econ-calc-problem + cant-justify-your-position at them, or that these are two different problems he'd throw at them at separate times?
The second option doesn't fit b/c of the way he's worded the sentence and the grouping of nouns.
The first option is *okay*, but why would he say that, isn't the econ-calc problem enough?
Is he just pointing out (to them) that we should not have contradictions in our ideas (which is presumably why their position on econ-calc problem is impossible to justify)?
Why is he picking on Marxists/Leninists only? (Though my experience - of uni in Australia - is there aren't many other active pro-communist groups that are accessible and out-and-about.)
RSP should not be so **careless**.

Claiming to have publicly attacked Marxists/Leninists **raises relative social status** and is **self-aggrandising**.

"used to love" is odd compared to "loved" -- it the comparative implication is that he doesn't love it anymore?

Typo/grammar errors:

* "Lenninists" has an extra 'n'
* "throwing the Economic Calculation Problem at them plus the impossibility of justifying one's position"
  * 'at them' modifies 'throwing' but RSP then uses a conjunction to add another noun, so the intended meaning is: "throwing A and B at them", not "throwing A at them plus B". (the latter being unprincipled / overly casual / ambiguous / etc).

> Talk about a double punch to the jaw! It was easy though - they all had glass jaws. 😂

More **self aggrandising** (look at how good I am, esp compared to other ppl who tried the same thing).

More **metaphorical violence**, including "glass jaw" which is [explicitly a boxing/fist-fighting reference](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glass%20jaw).

The emoji "😂" expresses laughter and emphasises the previous sentences, showing how **casual and embracing of metaphorical violence** RSP is.
There's minor **social pressure** on others to find this entertaining / funny too.

> As for critical rationalism getting "entrenched", what's needed is to get out there and apply it to various problems in different domains.

RSP indirectly points out 'entrenched' was a weird word for Birner to use, but **talks past it (non-sequitur)**.
RSP is ambiguous about what "it" is, but it's easy enough to read that he's talking about CR (not 'CR getting "entrenched"') b/c it's posted to a CR forum.

He's also **projecting expertise**, esp because there are no qualifiers like 'I think' or even something like 'the best way' (which would at least acknowledge other solns are possible).

He **does not give examples or explanation** and moves on.

> I also think that yes, we lost the great Popperian Knights Peter Medawar and Sir John Eccles, but there are major living scientists who do respect philosophy and often refer to Popper's work - Frank Tipler the astrophysicist (who described Popper's Logic of Scientific Discovery as one of the most important books of the 20th Century), for example, and many others.

This is RSP's messiest and longest sentence.

He starts "I also think that yes, ..." even though: nobody else mentioned PM or JE, and there's no need for this **false/irrelevant concession** (it's a concession because of the usage of "yes").

It's another **metaphorical violence** reference and **invokes simplistic ideas of virtue** via the use of "Knights".
This also **name drops** to (presumably deceased) people.
"Sir" is an **appeal to status** and **raises relative social status** (because RSP knows a knight in the modern sense).
While there's ambiguety between old ideas of knighthood (righteous violence) and the modern idea, we know RSP is invoking the old idea particularly b/c the full adjective is "Popperian Knights", which both includes Peter Medawar (who presumably doesn't have a title like 'sir') and relegates the knighthood to *defending Popper*.
We **shouldn't need violence** to defend good ideas (even if it's metaphorical violence) -- RSP **should have known better**.

It also implies the *act* of defending Popper is what's virtuous, not *having good ideas* -- RSP **should have known better**.

His use of "major living scientists who do respect philosophy" which is a **veiled attack on scientists who RSP disagrees with**.
It's also an excuse to **name drop Frank Tipler** ("the astrophysicist") in a way that doesn't really add to the conversation except to point out some scientists are still concerned with philosophy.
(c6) Indirectly it's **anti-criticism** wrt other ideas, though it can be overlooked as an inappropriate level of detail for this post.

The parenthetical on Tipler is largely irrelevant to scientific works; it's more relevant to philosophy of science.

(todo: rest of this sentence)

> Rational argument has a force of its own, as I argue in depth in my book.

He somewhat contradicts himself with the mostly-true "rational argument has a force of its own" statement (though **repeats the misuse of 'force'**).
However, that contradiction is in service to **self-aggrandisement** via mentioning his book, further **raising relative social status and projecting expertise**.

It's possible LT mentioned RSP just so he could mention he wrote a relevant book, which is something LT **should have done**, but otherwise **moving through social motions**.

"cold autumn wind" could be a reference to 1984's "It was a bright cold day in August when the clocks were striking 13". (todo: check 1984 quote)
