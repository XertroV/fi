## analysis

> (1) While I sympathise with the spirit of this post, I am far more optimistic.

What's the spirit of the post? (Presumably the same as the spirit of the quoted text.)
The spirit of the text is about CR being hard (or on the way to extinction, or not worthwhile) because it's incompatible with necessary evils like social stuff or things that academics *need* to do these days.
And because ppl in CR can't adopt other traditions (which is false).
And that this has something to do with the personalities or characteristics of ppl in CR.
It sort of sounds like it's against politicking to start with but most of the extract is about CR being bad at things it's not.
The article is fairly anti-CR, though.

Why sympathise with that?

One reason to say it is to seem like you're able to understand lots of points of view and see the good in what people say even if you disagree. the social reaction to this is generally positive. it's a way to not seem like you're being as critical even though you disagree with something. Because it's done for social reasons **this type of sympathy is false**, though.

It's **supporting something anti-CR** to artificially **downplay** a disagreement more socially acceptable.

She also says the *spirit* of the post, (which I'm reading like "in the spirit of the law") which is both **hedging** by not telling you much and **possibly sidestepping issues** w/o dealing with them properly or discussing them (depending on the rest of her post).

She says she's optimistic. That implies the extract is pessimistic (I mean it's not optimistic). Saying "*more* optimistic" means it gives **false credit** to the original article for being better / more optimistic than it is.

> (2) There’s a premise here that critical rationalism is incompatible with social networking and politicking

This *seems* fine. The politicking is like a major point, though, and Birner rags on CR more than just this particular (hedged and alleged) incompatibility. The indirect way she's talking can diminish the apparent importance of the disagreement or avoid it. (though maybe avoiding it is a good idea, like just arguing a small number of points, politicking being one of them; if she can argue against that then it's pretty important to the rest of the extract)

> (3) But you can have all sorts of interests as a critical rationalist.

Yes, but there are also lots of interests you can't have (at least if you're a halfway-decent critical rationalist). I'm not sure if it's **dishonest** to speak this broadly about it.

> (4) Why would social networking and politicking be special?

I don't think Birner says they couldn't be interests, he says CR ppl don't like devoting resources to doing them.
You can study something (be interested) without doing it.
This might just be overly casual language (so **careless**) or deliberately **reframing/downgrading**.

Later in the article Birner implies a connection to different traditions (b/c they're both things that CR ppl can't do or do badly). I think she's **avoiding** a more serious disagreement.

> (5) Maybe the assumption is that critical debate isn’t compatible with these social endeavours, but I don’t think that’s true: there’s always a way of explaining an idea that isn’t off-putting; it’s not fundamentally the case that people dislike criticism.

There are more reasons it's incompatible; like politicking requiring dishonesty &mdash; or it's at least very hard to avoid consistently and takes a lot of effort. in those sorts of environments you're rewarded for certain kinds of dishonesty. **Avoidance, reframing**.

If she's talking about the *assume* in the second sentence ("let us assume (realistically, I think)") then that's not what it says -- it say's there's a possibility with the types of personalities by nature. If that's what she's talking about that (or about the thing that would lead to what's said in the second sentence), then she's **avoiding** the reality that Birner is making a much stronger claim about CR ppl.

> (6) (What they dislike is something more like: being trapped; being called bad; having problems that destabilise/overwhelm; etc.)

So, yeah, these things sound like ppl would dislike them, but people definitely don't want *some* criticisms no matter how you put it, right? Hmm, maybe. Don't know enough to judge.

> (7) (It’s possible to avoid all these problems and still have a critical discussion.)

You can avoid some of the problems some of the time, but not all of the problems all of the time.
Eventually they'll get in the way &mdash; **she should know this**.

> (8) (Or maybe the assumption is that people are not persuaded by argument, and instead you have to appeal to social status or bureaucracy.)

No response to this is given (tho it's in a parenthetical), it's sort of just **dismissed because RSP *might* agree with her.**

> (9) (Ray Scott Percival may agree with me here that this isn’t true either.)

**Name dropping**, raises social status if RSP is like well known or whatever.

> (10) Another apparent premise is that the only way to carry on these ideas is through institutional academia (which does indeed have its flaws).

Birner's article does imply that to have ideas survive you need to do academic politicking. The "which does indeed have its flaws" *hedge* is curious b/c it's unnecessary for the point. She doesn't really seem to be against it in any way, though. If academia was responsible for bad traditions (which Birner seems to imply, at least by CR standards) then it's worse than just having some flaws.

I feel like this is making one concession to hide another.

> (11) But it’s becoming ever easier to work outside the system (books, blogs, videos, forums, etc.), and even build intellectual communities and organisations to keep these ideas going.

Over a long time scale maybe? Access has increased, not sure if that makes it easier. There are definitely a lot more communities now than 50 yrs ago, and a lot more ideas going because of it.

> (12) You don’t need to be an academic to engage with academia, either.

This is pretty unrealistic. Maybe if you were really good at being impressive to academics and had some vouch for you? But realistically you do. Just b/c it'd be possible to engage (problems are soluble) doesn't mean it's easy / accessible / worth while. There's also a lot of cultural stigma. **dishonest**

> (13) Problems are soluble.

This is fine (in isolation at least).

> (14) There will be a solution to the problem “how do we ensure CR survives without doing unpleasant academic tedium?”.

She's downgraded politicking to tedium, which is **downplaying** the seriousness of what Birner claimed. So, yeah, there's a solution, but the question as written isn't particularly interesting or relevant. BoI alone is probably enough to ensure CR survives without more tedium (excepting like ~everyone dying).

> (15) The quote talks about “personal characteristics” — so maybe it’s saying the personality type that gets into critical rationalism tends not to be the exuberant promoter/social type.

More **downplaying** by softening what Birner said. It makes it more socially acceptable and makes Birner seem more reasonable, or like Lulie thinks it's more reasonable.

> (16) (As an aside, the final sentence of the second paragraph seems to be saying “critical rationalists don’t actually take the clash of ideas seriously”!)

Why is this an aside? It's a serious accusation!

Did Lulie take the clash of ideas seriously between what Birner wrote and CR?

> (17) But truth is connected.

What is 'but' contrasting?

Sort of a meaningless statement.

> (18) Why not be interested in expressing ideas so that they’re appealing to other generations/traditions?

Because you risk compromising the idea and pandering? Because it hides disagreements? **Pretending disagreements don't exist**

> (19) New people from diverse intellectual backgrounds are getting interested in Popper regularly via Deutsch (who is himself still writing about critical rationalism).

I'm not sure how diverse that background is, like the volume of ppl isn't that high, and most ppl don't learn much or well from BoI, and don't go on to study Popper directly. So she's **overly optimistic**

Where is DD writing about CR? He's done a bit on AGI, but I'm not aware of much on CR and he doesn't post to lists anymore. **Outright lie?** I mean presumably she's aware.

> (20) And there’s a lot of craving for these ideas lately — a lot of modern rationalist/skeptic communities trying to understand how to think about truth and knowledge, a lot of dissatisfaction for traditional academic philosophy, people who intuitively think objective morality makes sense but don’t know how to justify it, how to make sense of tyranny and liberalism, and so on.

This is a bit of a messy sentence. outline:

* there have been cravings for these (CR/Popperian) ideas lately
  * lots (!?) of rationalist/skeptic communities
  * dissatisfaction for traditional academic philosophy (rly?)
  * ppl who believe in objective morality but can't explain why it's true

I'm not sure this is true and it's not good to say you're doing well if you're not, like it's **denying** important things and problems. it backs up the optimism but this doesn't sound very realistic.

Also if people are learning badly and taking away half baked ideas that's not very good, it's maybe better than what they had before but it's not what they should be doing.

> (21) It’s very fertile ground for the next generation.

Saying things are good when they're not, **avoiding** issues.
