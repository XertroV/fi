My goal with this post is to tackle a small argument while communicating and structuring it well.
It's unlikely anyone here is familiar with it, which might be good b/c there's less preconceived knowledge.

The initial topic was: The Constitution of Australia says no one is eligible for office

I streamed the planning process: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIuebFA1jSY> (approx 2hrs; including grammar analysis)

ET and I looked over the planning in [Tutoring Max #14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVRkRhtZ2UA&list=PLKx6lO5RmaetREa9-jt2T-qX9XO2SD0l2&index=14)

## Australia has had an illegal and unconstitutional government for 119 years, and no citizen is eligible to sit in HoR or the Senate, even if they wanted to.

Australia's constitution is not very well written and has some problems like being internally inconsistent. It also has grammatical oddities (if not errors), and includes the implication any elected parliamentarian passing through foreign airports is automatically ineligible to hold office.

Obviously some (maybe all) of the following interpretations are outside *the spirit of the law*. The problem with this is that whether rules are enforced or not must be based on *potentially inexplicit* knowledge in judges' or magistrates' heads, which weakens the law because it becomes *less clear* when and how to apply it. This lack of consistency also means the *boundaries* between times we should or shouldn't apply aspects of the law are blurred. Thus people in Australian society who interact with these laws put themselves in a higher-risk situation than the original authors intended.

The section of the constitution that is relevant to this article is Section 44 (s44). After the 2016 election there were numerous parliamentarians who resigned due to falling afoul of s44. This triggered by-elections, but bought some MPs (members of parliament) enough time to fix the various issues, allowing some of them to win the by-election.

A person can be disqualified from being elected to parliament in five cases under s44, but we're only interested the first case (s44.i):

> [Any person who] is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or [any person who] is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power [shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives].

> &mdash; *[The Australian Constitution - Section 44](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution/chapter1/Part_IV_-_Both_Houses_of_the_Parliament)*

I created an outline of this sentence to make it easier to understand: (where `{...}` denotes a clause and `[...]` is replacing words with rough equivalents)

> {[anyone who] is [under X to Z]} or {[anyone who] is [Y or entitled to rights of Y] of [Z]}, {shall be [disqualified]}

* X: `any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence`
* Y: `a subject or a citizen`
* Z: `a foreign power`

### Analysing `s44.i`

Let's note a few things:

S44.i can disqualify people if they *acknowledge* "allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power", which is very broad. For example, if I am passing through an airport and given an instruction by local officials (e.g. TSA officers), I'm likely to comply. Those staff work for a foreign power, and complying with their instructions is showing obedience^1 to a foreign power.

S44.i also means that *claiming ignorance* is an acceptable 'get out of jail' card. I suspect the authors wanted to include some idea like *mens rea*, but they've introduced some odd side effects with their choice of phrasing.



[1]: There's a suitable definition of 'adherence' which fits this pattern, too, but the other two definitions in Webster's 1913 are more appropriate.
