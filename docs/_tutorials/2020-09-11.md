## Paths Forward (review)

PF is not a method. PF is something *have*, not something you *do*. It has been primarily (completely?) developed by Elliot Temple.

If someone has PF it means they have general methods for correcting errors. The *presence* (and adherence to) those methods is what provides PF. That presence is the solution to a very particular problem (and the related problems/questions):

> If you are wrong about something:
>
> * Are you *always* able to find that out? Why are you generally able to find out if you're wrong about something?
> * Can you be confident that this works for *anything* you could possibly be wrong about?

It's not specific to one domain (e.g. research into a particular topic), it applies to all elements of one's life.

The core of PF is about discussion. There are - broadly - two ways to find and fix an error. You can do it in your own head (thinking about it alone) or via discussion. Discussion is important because that's the *primary* way of getting a *variety* of ideas. Even reading a book is a simple discussion (sort of) - the author says a bunch to you.

How you do discussions matters b/c it affects whether they're high/low quality and whether they're productive or not. Unproductive discussions are ones where people don't learn anything, don't resolve disagreements, do things around goals other than furthering the discussion and learning, the ppl talk cross purposes, etc. If you have lots of unproductive discussions it's unlikely you have good PF because these discussions don't answer the core question.

## efficiency

* cite material
* develop a library of criticism
  * link ppl to that
* allow conversations to go deep to find root causes of disagreements
* fail early (don't have long breadth-first discussions by default)

## helpful things

* debate policy
* track record of public debate / discussions
* write & publish stuff

## epistemic stuff

* if something isn't public it hasn't been contributed to the project of human knowledge

## discussion forum thoughts

Discussion forums are important. Practically, most public discussion happens via discussion forums. The vast majority of *enduring* conversations take place on these forums, and last beyond the life of the website (e.g. via archive.org).

Despite the significance of d.forums, they have not significantly improved beyond newsgroups. The basic model is still: a starting post begins a thread, and discussion takes place via a list of replies. This is still the simplest and safest model used.

Some other models are used from time to time but they have big downsides. Facebook allows replying directly to other replies to a maximum depth of 1. Reddit has a full tree structure but has poor support for navigating that structure. Reddit also locks old posts by default, positively biases comments early in the thread history, and negatively biases deep comments.

There are lots of problems with how comments and posts are ranked, too. In general there's no good way to algorithmically find the *best* posts, though you can find the posts people like to click on, or like to reply to, or want to promote (by upvoting). These aren't useful things if you're interested in the best *discussion*.

What are the things that can offer an improvement over current forums?

### High value features

* Replies to replies
* optional metadata on related posts (sort of like replying to multiple comments)
* Excellent support for quoting, emphasis, links, footnotes
* Copying a message copies emphasis and other markup
* Quotation inline by default (not a top/bottom post system -- that should be an optional way to *render* posts)
* Modest support for rich content
* Anonymous posting / easy to use aliases
* View mode: as tree (ideally with multiple sorting methods)
* View mode: as list (like curi.us)
* Edit history fully public
* Server side rendering
* Rendering method supports arbitrarily deep discussions (even if there's something like pagination going on)
* Ctrl+F **always** works (no collapsing)
* Archives easy and accessible

### Features with some positive value

* A reply should be able to kick off a new thread
* Ideally copying from the page automatically adds a later of quotation
* Reputation and history for all posters (including disposable anons)
* Verified authorship when desired
* Automation compatible design (e.g. traversal/analysis)
* Context provided by default when permalinking
* Collapsible tree nav (never by default)
* Easy to traverse history of a reply
* Cryptographic ID support (e.g PGP/simple ECDSA)
* optional "undo" feature for like 1min after hitting "post", like gmail sending email
* good preview of post
* draft posts for prelim discussion *(low confidence -- why bother?)*
