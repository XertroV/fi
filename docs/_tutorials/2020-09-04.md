## pre-tutorial - postmortem thoughts

* I made a [big tree on some thoughts on solomonoff induction](../../files/pdfs/2020-08-31-solomonoff-induction.pdf) the other day.
* I'm not sure if I effectively reached my goal
  * the goal was to explore some things about the way SI views hypothesis programs
    * I think some things are left out which are important, like how details about how data is encoded. particularly stuff like parameters, e.g. the scenario params for how data was gathered.
    * Also I think there might be a way to find deficiencies of SI via self-referential problems. e.g. a program which generates its own parameters -- note: this example isn't complex enough to actually test, but I think some more sophisticated constructions might be able to.
  * Some problems I think I ran into:
    * most of the ~2000 words are not related to SI, but to setting up a conceptual model of how ideas work and what things we need to evaluate them
    * I got to the end and it wasn't necessarily clear how to construct a self-referential problem, though I might just need to spend a bit more time thinking on it
    * I ran into limits of my knowledge on SI
      * in part this is due to low-quality accessible explanations of it, and inaccessible academic formulations
