----

- idea for post (for max):
  - how should one respond to impasses
  - why is discussion methodology important

----

next time: bigger picture goals, life, and tutoring going forward

## reflection

- not quite sure how to do more re: bigger picture goals, just more detailed?
- I feel like i'm regressing maybe, like focusing more on other things again means I'm getting lazy

## Goals

- Write docs about IBDD (Flux)
- Get better at writing
  - I don't feel like I've done enough
  - quality isn't high enough
  - not 'easy' enough in general (it is somewhat easy when I'm 'inspired')
- Reading habit not instantiated
- Improving my discussion capability
  - quality
  - I want to be able to effectively *lead* a discussion
