## 15 min writing exercise parameters

Idea:

* break answering Qs down into 15 min
  * 2 min planning
  * 10 min writing
  * 3 min editing
* it's 'bite sized' but better than the 1+5 minute thing I did last time (since that was too short)
* maybe longer overall or difference balances between stages can work but this is a good starting point
  * can iterate
