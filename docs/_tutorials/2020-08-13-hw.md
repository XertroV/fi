## Analyzing Lies

* [Post re: first 2 lines](../../analyzing-lies/01-birner-quote)

## 15 min writing exercise parameters

Idea:

* break answering Qs down into 15 min
  * 2 min planning
  * 10 min writing
  * 3 min editing
* it's 'bite sized' but better than the 1+5 minute thing I did last time (since that was too short)
* maybe longer overall or difference balances between stages can work but this is a good starting point
  * can iterate

### how can you write to better communicate to people generally?

- put ideas down
- explain self
- make sure complete sentences
- each sentence an idea
- build up ideas, snowball them
- plan out first so you know where to start and where to go
- don't put too much in one sentence
- keep audience in mind
  - you're writing for a goal
- to communicaate better the audience is the important thing, their ability to understand is how you judge how well you did
- don't stop if you get stuck
- you can always edit stuff
- a timer helps me b/c i can't stop
- so i don't think too much on one thing
- you need to think about how much readers know
- what's appropriate fro them
- because they shouldn't need to learn anything 
- but should understand what you say
- so too much detail is bad
- but not enough is bad too , or too long

when you want to write so you're communicating better, you want to make sure your ideas are understood by other people.
for them to understand your ideas they need to be able to read what you wrote once through and have a fairly good idea of the structure and content.
that means you need to build up your new idea using easy to understand simple ideas that the person already knows.
if you do this, they will be able to follow and understand everything you write.
you might think you already do this, but if you're reading this, you probs have room to improve.
so what should you change to do this better?

you should consider - at a high level - how you're going to structure things.
when we put ideas down on paper, you can put them down in a regular and consistent way that matches what people expect.
people don't expect you to say everything important in the first paragraph and then have lots of nitty gritty details in all the other paragraphs.
they expect you to introduce new ideas through the entire article.
they expect you to *build up* to what you want to say, not to say it all at once in confusing language and then not explain it in the rest of the article.
if it's too confusing to start with they probably won't even read the rest.
if they couldn't understand your first sentence, why should they think they can understand the rest of them?

you should consider what your audience already knows.
it's good to give your audience the credit they deserve.
no one likes reading an article but having things they already know repeated to them.
they want to go there for new ideas.
that doesn't mean you should not say things they don't already know; that's useful for getting your audience on the same page with you.
this gives a standard foundation for you both to build the idea from.
but if you are too simple or repetitive in your language they'll get bored.
similarly, if you presume they know too much they will get lost (and maybe angry too, depending on the context).
so it's important to know what your audience knows, and write something that's useful to them.

you should also not be too concerned with what you put down initially.
we all make mistakes while writing, but that's okay -- what matters is that we can fix them.
for example, in this writing exercise i've spent 6.5 minutes writing so far (out of 10), so you can get a lot done in a few minutes.
it's important to keep the pace up if you want to write fast.
it's also better to leave editing to the end -- I have allocated 3 minutes after finishing writing -- because it's very distracting to do it *while* you're writing.
the main thing is keep ideas coming, and keep building them up incrementally.
if you do this you'll quickly have hundreds of words that are easy to understand! (Don't worry if you need a bit of practice, I did too, and I'm not even that good at it yet)

you should make sure everything you write has a purpose. you can ask yourself: how does this word or sentence add to the goal of what I'm writing?
does it help the reader get a better idea of what I mean? or does it get in the way?
if you put extraneous detail in, you'll lose people as they get bored.
so keeping things short and tight is good; readers like that.

While you're doing all this, remember that writing can be fun!
don't get too caught up in the idea of *being* a good writer or something.
if you have fun writing your writing will get better.
nothing is wrong with being a good writer, the problem is aiming for it.
