## He was waiting for the rain to stop.

```
(was :: verb
    he :: pronoun
    (waiting :: gerund
        (for :: preposition
            ((to stop) :: infinitive 
                (rain :: noun
                    the :: det
                ) :: subject
            )
        )
    )
)
```

* 'to stop' - could be (preposition,noun) but a noun would mean something like 'a stop' could be put in there, doesn't feel right => infinitive makes more sense

## Nobody's ever been bothered by being dead.

implied => Nobody [has] ever been bothered by being dead

```
(bothered :: verb, linking
    (has :: aux verb
        been :: aux verb
        ever :: adverb
    ) :: adverbial
    nobody :: pronoun
    (by :: preposition
        (being :: gerund
            dead :: adjective / object of 'being'
        )
    ) :: adverbial
)
```

* 'ever' adverb on 'has' 
  * -> usage: can remove 'ever', 'has ever', but not just 'has'
  * -> 'ever been to the moon?' -> implied 'have you'

bothered as root
nobody under bothered

* bothered becomes a linking verb bc

relative pronoun -> clause function as modifier 

## The main difference between object and complement in English grammar is that the object is what is affected to the action of the subject while the complement is a part of a clause that usually follows the verb and adds more information about the subject or object.

I found this on a grammar website.

{<[difference] between [x and y]>} is that {[x is [what is [affected to [action of [subject]]]]]} while {[y is [a part of [a clause that [usually follows the verb]]] that [follows the verb] and [adds info about [subject]]]}.

## I know about it (Objectivism) in name only (and only since learning about FI, and because of FI)

Note: I can definitely write this better (it's from [early learning: objectivism]({{ "../../pub-drafts/early-learning-objectivism.md" | relative_url }})). Left it like this for purposes of analysis, partly because I said 'and because'

## I can explain the acronyms if need be.

## It is a poor argument of my superior reason, that I am unable to make justice be apprehended and felt in the most necessary cases, without the intervention of blows.
