## He was waiting for the rain to stop.

```
(was :: verb
    he :: pronoun
    (waiting :: gerund
        (for :: preposition
            (rain :: noun
                the :: det
                (to stop) :: infinitive ?unsure?
            )
        )
    )
)
```

* 'to stop' - could be (preposition,noun) but a noun would mean something like 'a stop' could be put in there, doesn't feel right => infinitive makes more sense

        ever :: adverb)

    nobody :: pronoun

                )
            )
        )
    )

```

  * -> usage: can remove 'ever', 'has ever', but not just 'has'
  * -> 'ever been to the moon?' -> implied 'have you'
