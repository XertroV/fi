## simple writing exercises (aiming for 1-3 paragraphs)

notes:

- practice:
  - beforehand
    - brainstorm relevant things, try to make atomic ideas / basic single chunks (or break down ideas into this)
    - have goal written down (can increase specificity as I write if needed), audience, purpose, pre-existing knowledge, etc
  - when writing
    - do an outline
    - each sentence should have a purpose
      - could analyse some answers after the fact and try and figure out the purpose
      - check each sentence for
        - vagueness
        - how does it help the goal
        - does the audience already know this (if it's not important to say for other reasons)
        - are there any common questions to pre-address
        - is the sentence consistent with the rest of the paragraph/answer
    - can write the same thing multiple times if stuck
    - don't fixate on one point; keep flow
  - eval after writing
    - if I've avoided some details: when someone learns the truth will they be surprised or feel betrayed; will it seem like a lie?
    - was anything left out that seems important?
    - any inelegancies that need cleaning up?

### Why shouldnâ€™t you look at the sun?

brainstorm:

- the sun emits LOTS of photons
- photons have energy
- photons can cause molecules to change if they're high energy or there are a lot of them
- our eyes focus light on to our retinas
- our eyes are used to normal daylight or below
- when our eyes focus normal daylight (not look at the sun) on to our retinas it doesn't do damage because our retinas can cope with it
- the sun is brighter than normal daylight
- when our eyes focus direct sunlight on to our retinas it's like when you use a magnifying glass
- all that light gets focused on to our retinas and they can burn
- this isn't normal for retinas so they can't heal
- that means permanent damage

we can see things because, when we look at them, the things reflect light and this light goes into our eyes and lands on the back-side (the retina).
Our retinas are made of many tiny sensitive light detectors.
These light detectors make signals when light hits them.
those signals go to the brain which turns them into the image we see.
all of these things need to work correctly for us to see, if anything goes wrong then we won't see anything.

there are lots of ways things could go wrong so that you don't see anything, but some are worse than others.
one reason you might not see something is if there's no light: maybe it's dark or you have your eyes closed.
if there's no light then nothing will land on your retinas and no signals will get sent to your brain (which is why you can't see when it's dark or your have your eyes closed).
that's easy to fix because you can just turn on a light or open your eyes.
other things can go wrong though, which might be very bad.
one way the might go wrong is if your retinas stop producing signals.
then it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed, you still won't see anything because no signals get generated so nothing gets sent to your brain.
if your retinas stop working forever then you might not ever see again.

[outline.s] light has energy

focusing light to a point makes a lot of heat in that spot.
light is usually spread out, but we can make a lot of light land on one spot using a lens (like the one in a magnifying glass)
if we do that, the spot where the light lands gets hot enough to burn things.
some people use a magnifying glass and the sun to burn pictures in wood.

our eyes are like little magnifying glasses; they each have a lens to focus light on to our retinas which makes the image.
this isn't a problem normally because our eyes can deal with the amount of light we get when we look at normal things like buildings, trees, books, or other people.

[outline.s] but if something is *really* bright - like the sun - it can shine a lot of light on our retinas.

[outline.s] retinas can't heal like cuts and bruises, so damage to them can be permanent.
doctors can't fix retinas very well, so if you damage them they might never heal, which means they won't work and you won't see anything anymore.

[outline.s] if we look long enough then it can do things like boil the insides of our eyes which will make you completely blind

(stopping here, it's long enough, might come back and edit later)

### What is swimming?

swimming is using one's body in coordinated motions to move through the water.
lots of animals swim.
people use their arms to pull themselves through the water, and their legs to push.
land animals that don't have arms usually use their front legs to pull and back legs to push.
typically, animals that live in the ocean swim using their whole body to push against the water.
lots of animals that live in rivers and lakes do this too.
these animals often have smooth skin (or scales) and have big tails which makes swimming easier.

there are some exceptions to the normal ways of swimming, though.
some land animals, like snakes or alligators, have small legs or no legs at all, so they swim using their whole body like fish and dolphins.
some sea creatures, like adult crabs, aren't very good at swimming so tend to live on the sea floor.
some birds can swim, too.
penguins are one example; they use their wings both to push themselves through the water and to steer too.
