# Part 2: Complex Sentence Grammar

Breaking down sentences involves splitting at conjunctions and analysing the clauses recursively.

## phrases

* Clause -> simple sentence
* Phrase -> incomplete simple sentence
  * verb phrase - e.g. *very quickly ate* - (ate::verb (quickly::adverb quickly::modifier))
  * noun phrase - e.g. *the unusually cute cats" - (cats::noun the::modifier "unusually cute"::modifier)
  * adjective phrase - e.g. *unusually cute*

* Prepositional phrase -> preposition + noun phrase
* functions like adjective or adverb
* e.g., *during the day* -- (during::preposition (day::noun the::mod))

> *Warning:* Standard terminology uses the term “verb phrase” to mean “predicate”: the verb plus its object or complement, plus modifiers. It’d be reasonable to use “simple verb phrase” to mean a verb plus the adverbs modifying it.

## clauses

## conjunctions

* coordinating conj: each clause is equal, e.g. and, but, for, or, yet, nor, so. FANBOYS; can join some phrases
* subordinating conj: disparity in importance or order, etc: e.g. after, before, although, while, if; can only join clauses

## communicating

*paragraph level*

* main points should use verb, subject, object and complement. Modifiers for helper points (less important than what they modify)
* main points -> main clauses; helper points -> subordinate clauses (which must be deliberate; main clauses by default)
* > Detail: Relative pronouns can also make subordinate clauses. I won’t cover them, but I’ll give one example. In “John, who is a mechanic, loves restoring cars.”, “who” is a relative pronoun. It creates a subordinate clause that functions as an adjective that modifies “John”.
* use italics etc to give hints
* you can say "my main point is:"

## subordinating conj

writing without subordinating conjunctions sucks. elephants and zoo example.
