dialog - is there a case for #fi-lite (like a lower standards channel)

max: I think there's a good case, take these general benefits: place for beginnings to take part with lower standards; sets up an idea of progression; allows for more incremental learning; and it means participating isn't binary - allows people to stay connected with the community somewhat w/o completely leaving.

anon: what's your goal w/ #fi-lite?

max: Learning FI is hard. I think making it easier will help FI grow and that would be good. I want to see FI succeed.

anon: sounds like you want to get more ppl involved by pandering to them.

max: ... maybe; but the desire to help FI is independent of that. they could both be there. however, i don't want to compromise FI in order to promote it, that would be pointless.

anon: ...

max: okay, say we start with my goal, to help FI. what things would help beginners without compromising FI?

- it's not about lowering standards to pander, it's about practice

practice stages

- do it at all
- do it repeatedly (lower ER)
- do it fast
