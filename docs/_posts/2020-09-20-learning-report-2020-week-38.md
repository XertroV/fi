## notes

* finding overhead of managing postmortems, this site, etc sometimes-significant but not unbearable

## tutorials

* 40

## postmortems

* I said I'd do a retrospective (filling in for a monthly learning report) and I didn't. I should do a postmortem on that.
* [misreading IR](https://curi.us/2380-max-microblogging#18051) #18051
* [pm/2](../../pm/2)

## carry over

* started reading *the choice* again, up to ch12 (friday)

## misc

* SSOL speedrun improved to 2:20
  * this uses the same route but I have some new ideas.
    * I got 2:23 on a new route on like the ~5th attempt, so there's some good potential there
    * I also realised I thought there was a wall at the end of the main route but it's just bushes, so maybe there's a faster route that goes through that. it's a bit of a pain though b/c it's hard to manoeuver through that space without like hitting rocks or things
    * the current end is not a bad place to end b/c there are a lot of orbs in roughly a line. it's tricky to get them all in one go, though, and costs like 5s+ if you miss one (or more), so ending elsewhere could be good.
      * maybe I can try routing backwards instead?
