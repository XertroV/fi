Initial list from tutorial 34:

* who's putting in how much effort?
* who's asking for how much effort?
* who's reacting to who
* who gets to question who?
* who answers?
* who ignores counter-party requests?
* who gives hints and expects the counter-party to figure out what he means
* who's happy with status quo, who want's change, who's needy?
* calm is high status
* LoLE
* who's framing of the issue dominates?
* who's signalling expertise?

new stuff:

* who's making the conversation more basic whilst presuming they're correct? (acting like a teacher / being condescending)
  * it's like they're making the conversation more basic for the benefit of the other person, not the benefit of themselves.
* who's breaking rules and getting away with it?
* who's speaking on behalf of people?
* who's hedging as a tactic to misrepresent the counter-party's views?
* who's misrepresenting the counter-party in general?
* who's breaking trends/norms and who's following them? (both implicit and explicit norms)
* who's claiming they're great for some reason?
* who's not admitting weakness by acting confident? wrt philosophy/technical stuff: who's admitting weakness by asking clarifying questions?
* who's claiming to have demonstrated value in the past? (e.g. I've given away 30 books, etc)
* who's speaking more fancy than is required?
* who's signalling virtue via group approval? (e.g. 'we here think X' or something)
* who's phrased things so they could deny things later on? who's not putting forward their idea as something they believe in (which would make it hard to deny something later)
