I went through the maths in OP. I think the core inconsistency is that SI implies \(l(X \cup Y) = l(X)\). I'm going to redo the maths below (breaking it down step-by-step more). curi has \(2l(X) = l(X)\) which is the same inconsistency given his substitution. I'm not sure we can make that substitution but I also don't think we need to.

Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent hypotheses for Solomonoff induction.

According to the prior: the non-normalized probability of $X$ (and similarly for $Y$) is:

\begin{equation}
P(X) = \frac{1}{2^{l(X)}}
\end{equation}

what is the probability of \(X\cup~Y\)?

\begin{equation}
P(X \cup Y) = P(X) + P(Y) - P(X\cap~Y)
\end{equation}
