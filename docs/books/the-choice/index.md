## Chapter 1

One's choice of how to perceive reality (with regards to problems) is (one of?) the most important and impacting
choices of one's life. It is necessary to live a full life. In the chapter it's called the scientist's approach.

Broadly, if one wants to live a full life one must make some core decisions, and particularly one decision. That is:
problems are soluble, solutions are attainable, and that one CHOOSES to devote the time to understand the problems that
come up and how to solve them. (though it's not expressed in The Choice like this, I think BoI puts the idea simply, so
use that language here.) The way to do this is the scientist's approach: we can know about and prepare for the world in
such a way that failures become opportunities to learn, and we can find that energising. Common perceptions of reality
have two problems: avoiding using brain power because we think we don't have it, problems & solutions must be super
complex, so we dont have the right tools; and an unwillingness to see reality for what it is, and applying the wrong
knowledge in search of the soln. The chapter ends with the conjecture that complex reality is actually simple, and Eli
and Efrat agree to analyse a big apparel company to figure it out, next time on The Choice.

## Chapters 2 and 3

Main Idea: The demonstration of the common sense logic in ch1 (ch2) and Efrat's reflection on said logic and the report from ch2.

Chapter 2 is a walk-through of the common sense referred to in
chapter 1 via an analysis of "Big Brand" and possible improvements to their operation. It
exposes several ways Big Brand fool themselves with language and methodology. It also
details the chain of reasoning by which executives of Big Brand come to realise many of
their problems are addressable with changes to the way they deal with supply and
manufacture of their goods. 

Chapter 3 is Efrats reflection on the idea of common-sense logic from ch1, the report from ch2, and on what that means
for herself and one's life and approach to life. She agrees the reasoning in ch2 is logical
and common sense, but doesn't see how she could do that herself. 

She thinks there are
two barriers: not prioritising the biggest problem, and dismissing options early due to
perceiving reality as overly complex.

She posits that when people face undesirable situations (unable to make progress due to their belief in a complex reality and thus unwillingness to look for solutions seriously), a (maybe minor) breakthrough is required. There must be some knowledge creation to make progress.
Furthermore, this breakthrough creates meaningful opportunities, and that it is not lack of brainpower which enables this, but a lack of efficacy in its usage.

A side effect of the *typical* way people deal with these problems (where they are convinced they cannot be fixed/removed) is to lower their expectations about life. In the context of Big Brand this manifested as focusing on minor improvements like cost reduction.

Finally, she concludes a good perception of reality is effective and powerful. The implications of this are not acknowledged at this point, but this is epistemically significant in a way Efrat has not yet realised.

**Parallels to BoI**: elegance in hard-to-vary explanations; theory-laden results (forecast is bad => shortages and surpluses); new knowledge proves some element of existing knowledge wrong ("The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that I would never say, "Away with using a forecast,""); one's perception of reality impacts and directs one's life.

## Chapter 4

Main idea: problems are less complex than people typically assume, we can come up with explanations for cause-effect relationships in the associated systems, and these explanations have significant reach.

Eli suggests that the idea of "Inherent Simplicity" has a deeper connection to reality than people usually entertain. Efrat has made this mistake: "I've treated your teaching as a collection of excellent methods. Not as a way to reach a full life." Eli notes that he doesn't see a difference between methods of analysing reality and methods of living a full life; he takes reality seriously and is not an instrumentalist. Eli explains these ideas via Newton's view, expanding on it slightly to make it more obvious that all reality is included, not just "nature" (physics, chemistry, etc).

He explains most ppl think asking 'why' leads to greater complexity, but the nature of reality is such that we can find good explanations.

**Parallels to BoI**: reality is objective and consistent;
