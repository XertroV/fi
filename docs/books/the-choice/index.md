## Chapter 1

One's choice of how to perceive reality (with regards to problems) is (one of?) the most important and impacting
choices of one's life. It is necessary to live a full life. In the chapter it's called the scientist's approach.

Broadly, if one wants to live a full life one must make some core decisions, and particularly one decision. That is:
problems are soluble, solutions are attainable, and that one CHOOSES to devote the time to understand the problems that
come up and how to solve them. (though it's not expressed in The Choice like this, I think BoI puts the idea simply, so
use that language here.) The way to do this is the scientist's approach: we can know about and prepare for the world in
such a way that failures become opportunities to learn, and we can find that energising. Common perceptions of reality
have two problems: avoiding using brain power because we think we don't have it, problems & solutions must be super
complex, so we dont have the right tools; and an unwillingness to see reality for what it is, and applying the wrong
knowledge in search of the soln. The chapter ends with the conjecture that complex reality is actually simple, and Eli
and Efrat agree to analyse a big apparel company to figure it out, next time on The Choice.

## Chapters 2 and 3

Main Idea: The demonstration of and Efrat's reflection on the
common sense logic ch1.

Chapter 2 is a walk-through of the common sense referred to in
chapter 1 via an analysis of "Big Brand" and possible improvements to their operation. It
exposes several ways Big Brand fool themselves with language and methodology. It also
details the chain of reasoning by which executives of Big Brand come to realise many of
their problems are addressable with changes to the way they deal with supply and
manufacture of their goods. Chapter 3 is Efrats reflection on this and on what that means
for herself and some of the claims in Ch 1. She concludes the reasoning in ch2 is logical
and common sense, but doesn't see how she could do that herself. She thinks there are
two barriers: not prioritising the biggest problem, and dismissing options early due to
perceiving reality as overly complex.



Finally, she concludes a good perception of reality is
powerful.
