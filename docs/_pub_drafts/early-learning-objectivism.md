1. I know about it (Objectivism) in name only (and only since learning about FI, and because of FI)
2. google: "define:objectivism" - 2. [Philosophy] the belief that certain things, especially moral truths, exist independently of human knowledge or perception of them.
3. wiki/objectivism: Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".

thoughts:

* sounds super compatible with ideas re objective morality in BoI
